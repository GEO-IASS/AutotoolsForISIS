1. INTRODUCTION

A. Neo-Geography Toolkit

The Neo-Geography Toolkit (NGT) is a collection of tools for automated
processing of geospatial data, including images and maps. It is capable
of processing raw raster data from remote sensing instruments and
transforming it into useful cartographic products, such as visible image
base maps, topographic models, etc. Additionally, components of the NGT
can perform data processing on extremely large geospatial data sets (up
to several tens of terabytes) via parallel processing pipelines.
Finally, it can also transform raw metadata (i.e.  SPICE kernels and PDS
image labels), vector data (e.g., 2D/3D shape files), and geo-tagged
data sets into standard NeoGeography data formats, such as KML.  NGT is
an evolving collection of loosely connected open-source modules designed
by the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group. Modules of the NGT will be
released one at a time, as they reach maturity. To date, we have
completed only one module: the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline, but more will
soon follow. Check this website for the latest updates.

B. AutotoolsForISIS

This collection of scripts are used to apply a build system to USGS's
ISIS3 Software. Having a build system for ISIS allows that project to
be compiled on multiple platform and with finer control for how it is
built.

The primary purpose of AutotoolsForISIS is to create binaries that are
in a forum that is more easily shipped in the Binaries of ISIS. It
allows us to control which dependencies are used and what objects are
linked.

This distribution may include some bundled third-party software as a
convenience to the user.  This software, located in the "thirdparty/"
directory of the source code release, is not covered by the
above-mentioned distribution agreement or copyright. Binary releases
distribute third party software in both the "bin" and "lib"

depend on additional third-party libraries that the user is expected
to have installed.

3. DOCUMENTATION

There is no documentation and this project will always be extremely
prickly and hard to use. We have no control with how USGS releases
their code and thus AutotoolsForISIS may break unexpectedly.

B. Credits

The NGT was developed within the Autonomous Systems and
Robotics area of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames
Research Center.  It leverages the Intelligent Robotics Group's (IRG)
extensive experience developing surface reconstruction and tools for
planetary exploration---e.g. the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration
Rover missions---and rover autonomy.  It has also been developed in
collaboration with the Adaptive Control and Evolvable Systems (ACES)
group, and draws on their experience developing computer vision
techniques for autonomous vehicle control systems.
